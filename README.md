# covid19-count

https://andrewang0001.github.io/covid19-count/

Previous visualisations of COVID-19 data highlight the number of confirmed cases, ignoring those that have recovered or died.
This tool was made to illustrate the current number of cases in Australia, accounting for those no longer infected.

However, the data set no longer covers the variables needed. A rewrite is necessary.

The visualisation script was written in R, using these libraries:
- flexdashboard
- dygraphs
- tidyverse

Data were from Johns Hopkins University CSSE.
